  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     # Don't boot with headless mode
     #vb.gui = true
  
    # this option makes the NAT engine use the host's resolver mechanisms to handle DNS requests 
    # which essentially means that we can specify domain "redmine.me" to be resolved by our local hosts file 
    #vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
    # set the memory of the virtualbox
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", BOX_MEMORY]
  end

  # once the vm is started
  # use the bootstrap.sh file to install and setup redmine
  config.vm.provision "shell", path: "bitnami-bootstrap.sh"
  # config.vm.provision "shell", path: "update-theme.sh"
